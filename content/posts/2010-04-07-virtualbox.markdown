### VirtualBox - Open Source Software, replace VMware w/ license


Homepage: http://www.virtualbox.org/

VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 [virtualization](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Virtualization) product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). See "[About VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox)" for an introduction.

Presently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of [guest operating systems](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes) including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), Solaris and OpenSolaris, and OpenBSD.

VirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Sun ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.
