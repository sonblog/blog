# Adding signatures to mail


You can automatically add a personal signature to all the messages you send. You can also use an alternate signature if, for example, you have different signatures for internal and external  correspondences.





## To add a signature to all messages










**About this task**


You  can add a rich text signature to all the messages you send.

For information on digital signatures, see Encrypting and digitally signing e-mail messages in related links.







	
  1. Click File  >  Preferences, and then click  Mail.

	
  2. Click the Signature tab.

	
  3. Select Automatically append a  signature to the bottom of my outgoing mail messages.

	
  4. Enter text in the Signature  field. Click the T control to add rich text  features such as graphics and attachments.

	
  5. Optional: Click Append My vCard, and then change any of the information in the fields if needed.

	
  6. Optional: Click Append vCard to Signature.

	
  7. Optional: To move the vCard file to a location other than following your signature, cut and paste it to the new  location.

	
  8. Click OK.







**Results**


You  can change the signature at any time by repeating these steps and specifying a new signature. You can remove the signature by clearing the Automatically append a signature  to the bottom of my outgoing mail messages option. You can also change the information in your vCard and replace the existing version with an updated one.















## To use an alternate signature










**Before you begin**


Add  the signature that you use more frequently to your preferences as described in To add a personal signature to all messages. It is automatically added to all e-mails you send.

Save your alternate signature file to your computer. It must be a TXT, HTML, JPEG, bitmap, or GIF file. The file can exist anywhere on your computer, but you might want to store it in your Notes data folder for  convenience.









**About this task**


You  can use an alternate signature if, for example, you have a different signature for internal and external correspondences.


Tip: Use a plain text  file if you send messages to users of mail programs that display only text.


When you would like to use your alternate signature, follow these steps:







	
  1. When you start a new e-mail, the signature you specified in Mail Preferences automatically displays. Delete that signature from the e-mail message.

	
  2. Click Actions  > More > Insert  Signature.

	
  3. Select Import from File  (Text/HTML/Image), select a file type, select your alternate signature file, and click Open.

	
  4. Click OK.
