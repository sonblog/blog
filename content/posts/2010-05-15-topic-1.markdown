**PASSAGE 1. Đọc hiểu và chọn câu đúng. Ko dùng  translate google hay dictionary nhé.**

Throughout history, the search for salt  has played an important role in society. Where there was no salt near, it was  brought from great distances. Thus, salt became one of the most important  articles of early trade. Records, show that in areas of scarcity, salt was  traded ounce for ounce for gold. Rome's major highway was called the _Via  Salaria_, that is, the Salt Road. Along that road, Roman soldiers transported  salt crytals from the salt flats at Ostia up the Tiber River. In return, they  received a _salarium_ or salary, which was literally money paid to soldiers  to buy salt. The old saying: "worth their salt", which means to be  _valuable_, derives from the custom of payment during the Empire. The  caravan trade of the Sahara was also primarily an exchange of goods for salt.  Among ancient people there, to eat salt with another person was an act of  friendship. Slaves were often purchased with salt. Salt was so important in the  Middle Ages that governments retained salt trade as monopoly, or levied taxes on  its purchase. By then, people's social rank was demonstrated by where they sat  at the table above or below the salt.
Event today, in some _remote_ regions of the world, salt is a luxury item. In fact, in a few isolated areas of  Southeast Asia and Africa, cakes make of salt are still for money.
